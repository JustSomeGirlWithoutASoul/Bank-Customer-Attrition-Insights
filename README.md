**Project Conclusion**

High-balance customers are more financially aware and expect premium serviceâ€”they leave when finding better options.

Older customers tend to stay due to bank loyalty or to avoid time-consuming paperwork.

Regional differences significantly impact churn, suggesting region-specific strategies are needed rather than one-size-fits-all approaches.

Model tuning: Modifying classification threshold improved recall, ensuring more potential churners are identified, though this increases false positives.
